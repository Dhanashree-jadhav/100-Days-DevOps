DevOps 100 Days Challenge-Day 11 : ‚Äì Deploying a Java Application on Tomcat (Port 3002)

Introduction
In production environments, deploying applications on reliable servers is a crucial responsibility of DevOps engineers.
The Nautilus DevOps team recently completed the beta version of a Java-based application and decided to host it on a Tomcat application server.

In this task, I was asked to:

Install Tomcat on App Server 2 (stapp02).

Configure it to run on port 3002 (instead of the default 8080).

Deploy a given ROOT.war application from the jump host.

Ensure the app works directly on the base URL ‚Üí http://stapp02:3002.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: SSH into App Server 2
I first logged into the App Server 2 using the jump host:

ssh steve@stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Install Tomcat
Tomcat was installed along with its required components:

sudo yum install -y tomcat tomcat-webapps tomcat-admin-webapps
Enable and start the service:

sudo systemctl enable tomcat
sudo systemctl start tomcat
‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Tomcat to Run on Port 3002
By default, Tomcat listens on 8080. I updated the config file:

sudo vi /etc/tomcat/server.xml
Changed the Connector port:

<Connector port="3002" protocol="HTTP/1.1" ... />
Then restarted Tomcat:

sudo systemctl restart tomcat
‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Deploy the Application (ROOT.war)
The provided ROOT.war file was available on the jump host under /tmp.
I copied it to App Server 2:

scp /tmp/ROOT.war steve@stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:/tmp/
Then deployed it into Tomcat‚Äôs webapps directory:

sudo mv /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
Since it is named ROOT.war, Tomcat automatically deploys it as the default application.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Verify Deployment
Finally, I tested the application:

curl http://localhost:3002
‚úÖ Output:

<h2>Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!</h2>
This confirmed that the application was successfully deployed and accessible on the desired port.

üìù Conclusion
In this task, I successfully:

Installed and configured Tomcat on App Server 2.

Changed the port to 3002.

Deployed the ROOT.war application.

Verified that the app works at http://stapp02:3002.

This exercise gave me hands-on experience in deploying a Java web application on Tomcat, modifying its configuration, and ensuring smooth accessibility ‚Äî a core responsibility in real-world DevOps.

Tomorrow I‚Äôll tackle the next task ‚Äî stay tuned! üôå
