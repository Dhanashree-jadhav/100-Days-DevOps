DevOps 100 Days – Day 6: Automate a Cron Job on Linux

Introduction
Today, in my DevOps 100 Days Challenge 🚀, I worked on automating a simple task on Linux using cron. Cron is a scheduling utility that lets you run scripts or commands automatically at specific intervals.

The goal for Day 6 was to create a sample cron job on all Nautilus app servers that writes hello into a file every 5 minutes. This is a basic simulation of how system admins automate day-to-day tasks.

Step 1: Connect to the server using SSH
First, I logged into the app server from the jumphost:

ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
Enter yes to accept the server key.

Enter your password.

Tip: Repeat this for all app servers (stapp01, stapp02, stapp03).

Step 2: Check/Install Cron (cronie)
Check if cron is installed:

rpm -q cronie
If installed, it shows the version.

If not installed, run:

sudo yum install -y cronie
Step 3: Start and enable the cron service
Start cron and make sure it runs after reboot:

sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemctl enable crond
sudo systemctl status crond
You should see Active: active (running) — meaning cron is ready.

Step 4: Add a sample cron job
We want to run a command every 5 minutes that writes “hello” to /tmp/cron_text.

Add the cron job for root using:

echo "*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text" | sudo crontab -
Verify it:

sudo crontab -l
You should see:

*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
Important: Make sure the command is echo (not echp) and the file path is absolute /tmp/cron_text.

Step 5: Test the cron job
Wait 5–6 minutes, then check the file:

cat /tmp/cron_text
You should see:

hello
Cron will overwrite this file every 5 minutes automatically. ✅

Step 6: Repeat on other servers
SSH into stapp02 and stapp03 and repeat Steps 2–5. This ensures the cron job runs on all app servers, just like system admins intended.

Key Takeaways
Cron allows automatic scheduling of tasks in Linux.

cronie package provides cron functionality; crond is the service that runs it.

Cron jobs must use absolute paths and correct syntax.

You can automate repetitive tasks on multiple servers efficiently.

Tomorrow I’ll tackle the next task — stay tuned! 🙌
