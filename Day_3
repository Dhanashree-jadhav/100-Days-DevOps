Introduction
Today’s task focused on hardening server security by disabling direct SSH login for the root account on all application servers in the Stratos Datacenter.

What’s going on
Every Linux server has a “super boss” user called root.
Root can do anything — delete files, change settings, etc.

When you connect to a server from your laptop, you usually use SSH.
If the server lets you log in directly as root, that’s risky.
It’s like leaving your main door wide open with all your valuables inside.
Hackers try thousands of passwords on root because they know every Linux box has that account.

The safer way:
You log in as a normal user (like tony) → and when you need power, you use sudo to run a single command with admin rights.
This way the “root” door stays locked, and only your smaller, separate door is exposed to the internet.

What I Did
– Logged into each app server using a normal user account
– Edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config to set PermitRootLogin no
– Restarted the SSH daemon to apply changes
– Verified that root login is now blocked

Why This Is Important
Disabling direct root SSH login greatly reduces the risk of brute-force attacks on the superuser account. Administrators now log in with a normal user and escalate privileges using sudo, which is safer and easier to audit.

Key Commands

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# change PermitRootLogin to no sudo systemctl restart sshd

# restart SSH daemon ssh root@stapp01 # test root login (should fail)
