DevOps 100 Days â€“ Day 2

Introduction :
Today marks Day 2 of my DevOps 100 Days Challenge ðŸš€.
Iâ€™m taking one small hands-on task each day to strengthen my Linux and DevOps fundamentals and share my progress with the community.

For Day 2, my task was to create a temporary user account with an expiry date on App Server 2 using KodeKloud labs.

The Task
Create a user named ravi on App Server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter and set its expiry date to 2024-04-15.
Temporary accounts like this are useful for contractors or developers who need access only for a limited duration.

What I Learned
Linux user information is stored in /etc/passwd.

Temporary accounts can be created with an expiry date so they automatically become inactive after a certain day.

The useradd -e option sets an account expiry date at the time of creation.

The chage -E command can set or change the expiry date for an existing user.

passwd sets a password for the new user so they can log in.

You can verify the expiry date with chage -l username.

Steps I Followed

Key Takeaways
useradd -e sets expiry at creation time.

chage -E modifies expiry for an existing account.

Temporary user accounts improve security and reduce manual cleanup work.

Always verify your changes using chage -l.

Wrap-Up
Thatâ€™s my Day 2 of the DevOps 100 Days Challenge âœ….
Iâ€™ve learned about Linux user management with expiry dates for temporary accounts.
Tomorrow Iâ€™ll tackle the next task â€” stay tuned! ðŸ™Œ
