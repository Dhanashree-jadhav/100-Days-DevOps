<b>Introduction :</b>
Today marks the start of my DevOps 100 Days Challenge ðŸš€.
Iâ€™m taking one small hands-on task each day to strengthen my Linux and DevOps fundamentals and share my progress with the community.

For Day 1, my task was to create a user with a non-interactive shell on App Server 3 using KodeKloud labs.

#The Task#
Create a user named siva with a non-interactive shell on App Server 3.

This type of user is often used for service or automation accounts that should not have interactive login access.

#What I Learned#
Linux stores user account info in /etc/passwd.

A shell is the program that starts when a user logs in (bash, sh, zsh).

A non-interactive shell (like /sbin/nologin or /bin/false) prevents a user from getting a prompt.

Such accounts are common for system services and automation tools.

#Steps I Followed#
1. Connect to App Server 3 (credentials from lab details)

ssh tony@stapp03

2. Create the user with a non-interactive shell

sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin siva

3. Verify the user entry in /etc/passwd

grep siva /etc/passwd

#Wrap-Up#
Thatâ€™s my Day 1 of the DevOps 100 Days Challenge âœ….
Iâ€™ve learned about Linux user management and the difference between interactive and non-interactive shells.

Tomorrow Iâ€™ll be tackling the next task. Stay tuned! ðŸ™Œ
